# ABSC Security Checks Documentation

## Inventory Checks (ABSC 1.x)

### Device Discovery Check (1.1.3-1.1.4)

#### Overview
The Device Discovery Check is designed to systematically identify and catalog all network devices, ensuring comprehensive visibility of the IT infrastructure.

#### Objectives
- Discover all active network devices
- Capture device metadata (IP, MAC address, device type)
- Validate network asset inventory

#### Methodology
1. Network Scanning
   - Uses nmap or similar network discovery tools
   - Performs comprehensive network range scanning
   - Identifies active and inactive devices

2. Device Classification
   - Categorizes devices by type (server, workstation, network equipment)
   - Extracts manufacturer information
   - Identifies potential unknown or rogue devices

3. Metadata Collection
   - Capture IP addresses
   - Retrieve MAC addresses
   - Detect device operating systems
   - Identify network interfaces

#### Implementation Considerations
- Requires network scanning permissions
- Configurable IP ranges
- Supports multiple network protocols
- Minimal network disruption

#### Potential Risks
- Potential false positives
- Performance impact during scanning
- Requires careful configuration

#### Compliance
- ABSC 1.1.3: Active device inventory
- ABSC 1.1.4: Network device identification

## Authentication Checks (ABSC 2.x)

### Password Policy Check (2.1.1-2.1.3)

#### Overview
The Password Policy Check evaluates the strength and compliance of password management practices across systems.

#### Objectives
- Verify password complexity requirements
- Check password change frequency
- Validate password storage mechanisms

#### Methodology
1. Password Complexity Analysis
   - Minimum length (typically 12+ characters)
   - Required character types:
     * Uppercase letters
     * Lowercase letters
     * Numbers
     * Special characters
   - Prevent common password patterns

2. Password Rotation
   - Maximum password age (typically 90 days)
   - Prevent password reuse
   - Enforce periodic password changes

3. Authentication Mechanism Review
   - Check for multi-factor authentication
   - Validate password hashing methods
   - Verify secure password transmission

#### Implementation Details
- System-level password policy checks
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Configurable policy thresholds

#### Potential Risks
- Over-restrictive policies causing user frustration
- Potential lockouts
- Complexity vs. usability trade-offs

#### Compliance
- ABSC 2.1.1: Password complexity
- ABSC 2.1.2: Password change policies
- ABSC 2.1.3: Authentication mechanisms

## Backup Checks (ABSC 13.x)

### Backup Procedure Check (13.1.1-13.1.3)

#### Overview
The Backup Procedure Check ensures comprehensive and reliable data backup strategies.

#### Objectives
- Validate backup frequency
- Verify backup completeness
- Assess backup storage security
- Test backup restoration capabilities

#### Methodology
1. Backup Configuration Review
   - Identify backup schedules
   - Check covered system/data types
   - Validate backup target locations

2. Backup Integrity Verification
   - Check backup file integrity
   - Validate backup encryption
   - Verify backup rotation strategies

3. Restoration Testing
   - Perform sample restoration tests
   - Validate data consistency
   - Measure restoration time and success rate

#### Implementation Details
- Support multiple backup technologies
- Cross-platform backup analysis
- Configurable backup policy checks

#### Potential Risks
- Incomplete backup coverage
- Potential data integrity issues
- Performance overhead during backup

#### Compliance
- ABSC 13.1.1: Backup scheduling
- ABSC 13.1.2: Backup completeness
- ABSC 13.1.3: Backup storage security
